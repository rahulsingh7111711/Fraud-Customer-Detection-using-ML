#Anomaly Detection for Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent activities in financial transactions using machine learning techniques. It uses algorithms such as Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) for unsupervised anomaly detection. Additionally, the project visualizes and analyzes the detected anomalies and evaluates the modelâ€™s performance using a confusion matrix.
